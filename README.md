This is intended as an example flutter project that demonstrates:

* Drag and drop items on the screen.
* Add, select and delete items
* Reorder the height of items

In terms of flutter features this means:

* Draggable and positional use of multiple widgets
* Passing a data model/class down to widgets
* Changing the data and updating widgets including Set_state()
* Object keys
* Some basic documentation.

## What is this project?

“Emoji party” is an open-source project that I am working on. 

It is not intended to provide any direct value as an app or a game. (Although it would be funny if it turns into something like that).

All of the demonstrated functions in this repository are made freely available for other developers to use in their projects. As such all works in the Lib directory are licensed under creative commons [ CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) Other files are generated by the flutter framework and associated plugins and packages are under whatever licenses are connected to those projects. 

The project is a personal learning exercise, as well as, an easy-to-share project that demonstrates some functionality that I require in other private projects. This allows the occasional voluntary contributor or even a contractor to achieve some nice-to-have ideas, without any need for NDA’s, access rights, or red-tape. Hopefully this also contributes something to the open-source community. 

Feel free to fork and pull request for minor changes. Happy to get feedback.

Feel free to fork and make your own video tutorials based on this code. No attribution is required.( But, I’m always glad to hear about it).

## Development
Project state is frozen in order to keep it as a simple, understandable demonstration. 
Changes will only be to maintenance, documentation and fixes based on feedback.

New features are being developed in [emoji_party_2](https://github.com/SpiRaiL/emoji_party_2) 

## Testing

This is tested on Windows 10 and Chrome 106.0.5249.119
